title: "Compile-Time Configuration For Zig Libraries"
description: "Two ways to enable compile-time options for Zig library developers"

<p>If you're writing a Zig library, you might find yourself wishing to expose a compile-time configuration option to application developers. One of the reasons you might want to do this for performance reasons, preferring to do something at compile-time versus runtime. Consider this example using my <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/pg.zig">PostgreSQL library</a>:</p>

{% highlight zig %}
var result = try pool.query("select id, name from users where power > $1", .{9000});
defer result.deinit();

while (try result.next()) |row| {
  const id = row.get(i32, 0);
  const name = row.get([]u8, 1);
  // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When I wrote the library, I was unsure what level of runtime check I should add to <code>row.get</code>. My instinct was to add none. As the developer, you know that column 0 is an <code>integer not null</code> and column 1 is a <code>text not null</code>. Is it <em>really</em> worth adding an additional type and nullability check? But I wasn't sure if that was the right assumption to make.</p>

<p>One option would be to have two different <code>get</code> methods, one safe and one not. But that's a more confusing API and isn't always straightforward to implement without duplication (not all checks can be done at the top of the function as a guard clause). Another option would be to use <code>std.debug.assert</code>, whose behavior is controlled by Zig's optimization flag (e.g. <code>ReleaseFast</code>). But this is a blunt tool affecting all code. I myself want to run some code in <code>RelaseSafe</code>, but not have these specific PostgreSQL checks.</p>

<p>Zig offers two solutions. The first is to use global declarations in the root source file. The "root source file" is the program's main entry point (where the <code>pub main() void</code> function is located). By convention this is the application's "main.zig", but a developer can use any file name. The point is that it's controlled by the application developer, but can be accessed by a library developer using <code>@import("root")</code>. In our library code, we could do:</p>

{% highlight zig %}
const root = @import("root");

const assert_ = if (@hasDecl(root, "pg_assert")) root.pg_assert else true;
pub fn assert(ok: bool) void {
  if (comptime assert_) {
    std.debug.assert(ok);
  } else {
    unreachable;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Having our own <code>assert</code> function based on our own comptime configuration allows the application to run the whole of the application <code>ReleaseSafe</code> while excluding our library's assertion. To do so, the application developer merely needs to add the following to their <code>main.zig</code>:</p>

{% highlight zig %}
pub const pg_assert = false;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Zig's standard library uses this approach in a few places. For example, you might have done something like this to change the standard library's log level:</p>

{% highlight zig %}
pub const std_options = struct {
  pub const log_level = .debug;
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>There's a second option available through Zig's build system. As a library developer, the code is almost the same. Rather than importing "root", we import "config":</p>

{% highlight zig %}
const config = @import("config");
const assert_ = if (@hasDecl(config, "assert")) config.pg_assert else true;
// ...
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Application developers must define the options in their <code>build.zig</code>:</p>

{% highlight zig %}
const pg = b.dependency("pg", dep_opts).module("pg");
const options = b.addOptions();
options.addOption(bool, "assert", true);
pg.addOptions("config", options);
// add the pg module to their program as they normally would
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I believe the build-approach is newer and might be intended as the way forward. It is better scoped, i.e. it doesn't rely on library using distinct variable names like "pg_assert", and setting compile-time flags in the build script feels more cohesive than a bunch of globals in the root source file. Whichever approach you take, remember that compile-time configuration is less flexible for application developers since they now have to provide configuration at compile-time that, maybe in some cases, they rather do at runtime. So try to use this sparingly, if at all.</p>
